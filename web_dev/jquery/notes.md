# Jquery Study Notes

* I found that focusing on the w3schools study materials helped me to assimilate the information more effectively than jumping around to a lot of different sites.

* It was incredibly helpful for me to stop about every 5 to 10 minutes to do a small exercise to be certain that I understood the mechanics of whatever jquery feature I was studying. Taking even a moment to manipulate the code myself was essential.

* Adding notes to a text file that I keep on the topic helped. As did taking screenshots of particularly useful pages/examples.
