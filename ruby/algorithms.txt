Robot-Elevator Algorithm

Assuming the elevator is able to identify the Floor 1 button as a starting point and evaluate buttons in its line of sight to an integerâ€¦

(In this algorithm, a variable would be subtracted from and evaluated on each row as the left/right switch, calibrating from the right movement on the first floor.)

Until robot line of sight (RLOS) evaluates button to desired floor integer:
  -- Until there are no buttons in RLOS
    -- Move R/L (using an even/odd switch) horizontally
    -- If RLOS evaluates to desired floor integer, press button (BREAK)
  -- Move RLOS up one row
  -- Variable is updated (by adding 1)

Water Plant Algorithm

-- Check soil
-- if soil is dry continue, otherwise stop
  -- go to watering can
  -- until watering can is full
    -- fill watering can
  -- take watering can to plant
  -- until soil is moist
    -- pour water into plant
