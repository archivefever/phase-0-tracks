<!-- Semantic elements organize the content of a webpage so that it has flow and is intelligible.
<main> - main content of the body
<article> - self-contained content which should make sense on its own
<section> - general grouping in a document, usually with its own heading
<nav> - important links (sometimes in header)
<aside> - content (such as a sidebar) related to the surrouding content
<header> - contains introductory content such as logo, authorship, or nav links
<footer> - content at the bottom of a site with links, authorship, copyright, etc.

The browser displays the content in the order it appears in the html (although that can be modified using CSS).

I learned that I can use Sublime to create tracts of html text which i can drop into documents at any time using tabs (which i can set) and scopes (which indicate which documents and at which times snippets work). I will definitely use snippets in the future.

The most challenging concept for me is understanding the relationship between the various semantic elements and which ones should be nested within each other. There seems to be some variance in opinion on this topic. I will continue to refer to the MDN documentation and explore existing websites to see what formats and coventions are used there.
