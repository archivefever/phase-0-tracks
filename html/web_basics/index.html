  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In a stunning result, the <strong>Conservative Party,</strong> led by Theresa May, has lost has a governing majority, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/08/world/europe/british-general-election-results-analysis.html">winning only 318 seats,</a> short of the 326 needed for control of Parliament.</p>
  <h3>Three important outcomes:</h3>
  <ol>
   <li>There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament">hung  Parliament.</a></li>
   <li>May will strike a deal to form a minority government with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland.</li>
   <li>Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party gained 29 seats, but is <em>still 65 short</em> of having its own majority.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>What we still don't know:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What will DUP demand in return for its cooperation with the Conservative minority?</li>
    <li>Will Labour's gains (and the Tories' loss) be interpreted as referendum on Brexit?</li>
    <li>Does the poor showing of third-party candidates indicate that the recent trend away from two-party rule has crested?</li>
  </ul>
